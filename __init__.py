Happy womens day to all the females in this comment section!

Also once again loved your video mysticat, keep growing your channel with your amazing content, I have a suggestion, can you make these cursed things into a datapack, like just run one command and see the magic happening and armor stands spawning!, you could even customise it for all shapes, like you accidentally did for the hexagon!
I would really love to try the circle and this triangle, and even the shark, but Im too dumb too successfully copy you lol
